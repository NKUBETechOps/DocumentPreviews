In our previous post, we demonstrated how to enable document previews in Microsoft Dynamics Business Central FactBoxes with a minor customization. As rightly pointed out in LinkedIn post, the initial implementation in Part 1 allowed previewing only the first page of a PDF document.

To overcome this limitation, we've enhanced the FactBox images by introducing a new table structure that stores all pages of the attached PDF. This allows users to preview each page individually bringing a more complete and user-friendly experience to document handling in Business Central through AL Language.
